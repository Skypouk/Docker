# Docker project

The aim of this project is to deploy a basic application that uses nodejs and mongodb using docker.

This demo app shows a simple user profile app set up using 
- index.html with pure js and css styles
- nodejs backend with express module
- mongodb for data storage

All components are docker-based

## Requirements

In order to run the project, the user need to install docker 

## Explanation of the different steps

### Step 1: Building the my-app image

The user need to build the my-app image by running the following command :

```
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .
```

This command uses Dockerfile in order to build the image "my-app" with the tag "1.0".

### Step 2: Lunching the application

In order to lunch the application, the user need to run the three containers: mongo, mongo-express and my-app, and initialize the variables needed like MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME, MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD, etc.<br>

To facilitate this step and avoid pasting multiple long commands in the terminal, we used a .yaml file.

```
 docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
```

### Step 3: Using the app

As mentionned in the "docker-compose.yaml" file. We can access mongo-express User Interface on "localhost:8080" and the application on "localhost:3000" 

## Conclusion

This project enabled me to implement different docker concepts:
 - docker-compose in order to regroup related containers
 - docker volumes which are file systems mounted on docker containers to preserve data generated by the running container.
